These problems are appropriate for a course in consumer math or 
an easy course in finite math for business students.

I authored most of them myself, although a few are taken
straight from WebWorK's Open Problem Library.  You are free to 
use any problems authored by myself for whatever purpose you desire.

WeBWorK problems are written in the PGML language, which I
like to describe as a mixture of Perl and Latex.  See
https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Introduction_to_PGML.
